	abstract = {Wafer map defect classification is a key task for the semiconductor industry to improve the yield rate. Most wafer map defect classifications suffer from the problem of data imbalance and insufficient data. This paper proposes a global-to-local generative adversarial network (G2LGAN) method using the deep learning framework. It extracts global features and local features separately to generate effective data even in the imbalanced dataset. We use random undersampling to suppress the majority class of data. We use MobilenetV2 as the classifier and use two datasets for validation. One is an open dataset called WM-811K and the other is called 21-Defect built from the industry. Based on the serious dataset imbalance problem, this paper integrates data enhancement and random undersampling methods to optimize the dataset and uses the proposed classification network for classification tasks. The results of the WM-811K dataset show that the proposed method has a classification accuracy of 98.39 and an F1-Score of 93.01. We also conduct cross-validation on the 21-Defect dataset and the results show that the proposed method has good robustness. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of the Electro Sensitivity Discharge (ESD) robustness of Radio Frequency (RF) GaN HEMTs can result in different Human Body Model (HBM) ESD classifications due to different sample sizes, batch-to-batch variations, different test methodology and differences in the test set-up. For example, a low sample sizes per voltage level can lead to a higher classification level. Two GaN HEMTs processed in the same technology with different power ratings were investigated with (i) step stress testing, and (ii) with testing at one voltage level, using different test set-ups and different wafer and assembly batches. A lognormal distribution gives a good fit for the HBM failure voltages acquired from step stress testing and can quantify the differences between GaN HEMTs, test set-ups and different batches. The failure percentages observed with one level testing can be significantly lower than what is expected based on the step stress HBM failure distribution. Furthermore, the spread observed in the HBM failure distributions acquired by testing at one voltage level is significantly larger than the spread observed in the HBM failure distribution as determined by step stress testing. The differences between one level and the step stress failure distribution can be explained by presence of traps inside the GaN HEMT devices. Furthermore, the ESD classification according to JS-001 [1] is discussed and how Operating Characteristics (OC) curves can be used to compare ESD test plans with different sample sizes and number of failures observed. © 2025},

	abstract = {Integrated Circuits are made of various transistors that are embedded on a silicon wafer, these wafers are difficult to process and hence are prone to defects. Defecting these defects manually is a time consuming and labour-intensive task and hence automation is necessary. Deep Learning approach is better suited in this case as it is able to generalize defects if trained properly and can be a solution to segmentation and classification of defects automatically. The segmentation model mentioned in this study achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0036, a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.0576, a Dice Index (DSC) of 0.7731, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.6590. The classification model achieved 0.9705 Accuracy, 0.9678 Precision, 0.9705 Recall, and 0.9676 F1 Score. In order to make this process a more interactive, an LLM with Q&A capabilities was integrated to solve any doubts and answer any questions regarding defects in wafers. This approach helps automate the detection process thus improving quality of end product. • Successful and precise defect segmentation and classification using Deep Learning was achieved. • High-intensity regions after post-processing. • An LLM offering defect analysis and guidance was streamlined. © 2025 The Author(s)},

In this study, a novel multi-level relay Vision Transformer (MLR-WM-ViT) for mixed-type wafer map defect detection is proposed, achieving an accuracy of 99.15% by leveraging relationships among basic defect, defect number, and defect type. It employs an efficient Transformer architecture based on enhanced Convolutional Additive Self-Attention, which possesses global contextual information modeling capabilities with linear complexity. Furthermore, the MobileOne Stem and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling modules in the model effectively preserve multi-scale information and enhance the feature extraction capability. Moreover, a Multi-Level Relay Classifier exploiting defect latent interrelationships is elaborated to improve the performance of mixed-type defect detection. Experimental results based on the MixedWM38 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms numerous Convolutional Neural Networks and Visual Transformers with good robustness and moderate model size.

	abstract = {In the semiconductor manufacturing process, classifying defect patterns in wafer bin maps (WBMs) is essential as they reveal the root cause of defects. Engineers can improve the process by identifying the defect type to increase the yield. Recently, as semiconductor manufacturing processes have become more complex, mixed-type defects have become increasingly prevalent in WBMs, complicating their classification. In previous studies, complex, large-scale models with numerous parameters have been employed to address this complication. Although these models exponentially increase the number of parameters, their classification performance often becomes saturated, achieving only marginal improvements. Preprocessing methodologies such as denoising and feature generation can be applied to WBMs to address this problem, but these methods can potentially reduce performance. In particular, feature generation methods need help in extracting high-quality features from mixed-type defect WBMs because of their complexity. We propose a global feature identification layer, which is a deep learning layer with limited parameters, and a preprocessing method to overcome these challenges. The proposed layer can extract feature maps from mixed-type defect WBMs, even including those with overlapping defects, by separating features for single defects in the WBMs. The proposed layer performs preprocessing and extracts feature maps by multiplying the layer elementwise with the input data. During training, the layer is also trained along with the model. The experiments using the MixedWM38 and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed layer can be applied to any vision model utilized for the analysis of mixed-type WBMs, including state-of-the-art models, enhancing their performance, robustness, and interpretability. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Classifying wafer map failure pattern plays a crucial role in semiconductor manufacturing, as it can help identify the underlying cause of abnormalities, thus reducing production costs. Existing works have shown that deep learning methods have great advantages in recognizing failure patterns. However, recent studies mainly focus on utilizing attention mechanisms to pinpoint critical regions as salient features, while ignoring the imperceptible underlying features and the causal relationship between prediction results and attention. This paper introduces a model-agnostic classification framework that leverages counterfactual explanations to enhance attention. Our approach consists of two steps: counterfactual example generation (Explain) and attention-based classifier refinement (Reinforce). The counterfactual explainer is designed to identify key pixel-level features, the adjustment of which could lead to different predictions. These generated counterfactual examples reveal hidden causal factors in the classifier’s decision-making process. Then the classifier utilizes these pixel features as attention, conducting reliable classification under the guidance of counterfactual examples. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. It achieves an accuracy of 98.125% in the defect classification task on the WM-811K dataset and 92.544% on the MixedWM38 dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art attention methods such as SENet, CBAM, and Vision Transformer by over 5%. Our results highlight the superiority of our approach and its potential for practical implementation in the semiconductor manufacturing domain. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.},
