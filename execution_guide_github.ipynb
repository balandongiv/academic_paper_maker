    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* `topic`: A concise statement of your **specific research goal or area of interest**.\n",
    "  *Example:* `\"wafer defect classification\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `topic_context`: A description of the **broader scientific or industrial context** where your topic belongs.\n",
    "  *Example:* `\"semiconductor manufacturing and inspection\"`\n",

    "### 💡 *Not sure how to define your `topic` and `topic_context`?*\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Open the filtering prompt** template defined in the YAML file:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   research_filter/agent/abstract_check.yaml\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Copy the prompt structure** (including the placeholders for `topic` and `topic_context`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ask any LLM to assist**, by providing it the YAML prompt and a description of your research.\n",
    "   For example, you could say:\n",
    "\n",
    "   > 🧠 *\"Given the following prompt structure, and knowing that my research is about identifying AI-generated academic papers, can you help me fill in the `topic` and `topic_context` placeholders?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The LLM might then suggest:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   topic: \"AI-generated academic paper detection\"\n",
    "   topic_context: \"scientific publishing and machine learning ethics\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures your filtering prompt is both precise and contextually grounded, improving the accuracy of the classification.\n",
